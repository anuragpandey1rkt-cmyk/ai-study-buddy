AI Study Buddy is a comprehensive, gamified learning platform built with Streamlit. It leverages Groq (Llama 3) for high-speed AI generation and Supabase for authentication and backend database management.

This application acts as a personal tutor, allowing users to generate quizzes, summaries, flashcards, mind maps, and study roadmaps while tracking progress through XP and streaks.

🚀 Features
🧠 AI Learning Tools
Explain Topic: Get explanations tailored to different levels (5-Year Old, High School, University).

Quiz Generator: AI-generated interactive quizzes with instant feedback.

Summarize Notes: Upload PDFs or paste text to get structured bullet-point summaries.

Mind Maps: Generate visual mind maps for complex topics (downloadable as PNG).

Flashcards: AI-generated flashcards for quick revision.

Chat with Documents (RAG): Upload a PDF and chat specifically about its content.

Exam Mode: The AI sets a question, grades your written answer, and provides feedback.

🎮 Gamification & Tracking
XP System & Leaderboard: Earn XP for every study activity and compete globally.

Streaks: Daily tracking to keep you motivated.

Badges: Earn achievements like "Bronze Scholar" or "Week Warrior."

Smart Focus Timer: Pomodoro-style timer with Focus/Break cycles that auto-awards XP.

Weekly Progress: Visual charts of your study time.

🛠 Utility
Study Roadmap: Generate a day-by-day plan to learn any skill.

PWA Ready: optimized for mobile usage (Installable as a web app).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

AI Inference: Groq API (using Llama 3 models)

Backend & Auth: Supabase

PDF Processing: PyPDF2

Visualization: Graphviz

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

A Supabase account (for Auth and Database).

A Groq API Key (for the LLM).

Graphviz installed on your system (required for the Mind Map feature).

Windows: Download Installer

Mac: brew install graphviz

Linux: sudo apt-get install graphviz

2. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-study-buddy.git
cd ai-study-buddy
3. Install Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt file (if not present) with the following and install it:

Plaintext

streamlit
supabase
groq
PyPDF2
graphviz
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configuration (Secrets)
Create a .streamlit folder in the root directory and add a secrets.toml file:

Bash

mkdir .streamlit
touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
Open .streamlit/secrets.toml and add your keys:

Ini, TOML

SUPABASE_URL = "your_supabase_project_url"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your_supabase_anon_key"
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"
🗄️ Database Setup (Supabase)
You need to create two tables in your Supabase project for the app to work. Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Create user_stats Table
Stores XP, streaks, and levels.

SQL

create table user_stats (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  xp int default 0,
  streak int default 0,
  level text default 'Beginner',
  last_study_date text
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) is recommended, 
-- but for a quick start you can disable it or set policies.
2. Create study_logs Table
Tracks daily study minutes for the graphs.

SQL

create table study_logs (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  minutes int default 0,
  activity_type text,
  date text
);
🏃‍♂️ Running the App
Run the application using the Streamlit CLI:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
Note: Replace app.py with the actual name of your Python file if it is different.

📱 Mobile Support (PWA)
The app includes meta tags to function like a native app on mobile devices.

Open the app URL on your mobile browser (Safari/Chrome).

Tap Share (iOS) or Menu (Android).

Select "Add to Home Screen".

It will launch in full-screen mode without the browser bar.
